# TeensyDMX

This is a library for receiving and transmitting DMX on Teensy 3.

There is no support yet for processing RDM.

## Features

Some notable features of this library:

1. Teensy's default serial buffer isn't used; the data goes directly to/from
   the DMX buffers from/to the ISR's.
2. Simple API: After setup, there's only one read call (`readPacket`) and two
   forms of one write call (`set` for single and multiple channels).
3. The library properly handles DMX packets containing less than 513 slots.

## How to use

The classes you'll need are in the `qindesign::teensydmx` namespace:
`Receiver` and `Sender`. Complete examples of how to use each are in `Flasher`
and `Chaser`, respectively.

All class documentation can be found in `src/TeensyDMX.h`.

### DMX receive

First, create an object using one of the hardware serial ports, different from
any serial ports being used for transmission:

```c++
namespace teensydmx = ::qindesign::teensydmx;

teensydmx::Receiver dmxRx{Serial1};
```

Before using the instance, start the serial port internals:

```c++
dmxRx.begin();
```

Using your own buffer whose length is at least `len` bytes, check for a packet
having arrived, and if it has, copy `len` values starting from channel
`startChannel`:

```c++
// For this example, assume buf is at least len bytes long
int read = dmxRx.readPacket(buf, startChannel, len);
```

`read` will contain the number of bytes read, -1 if no packet is available, or
zero if no values were read.

Note that channel zero contains the start code, a special value, usually zero,
that occupies the first byte of the packet. The maximum DMX packet size is
513, but may be smaller, depending on the system.

Each call to `readPacket` is independent, meaning that if no packet has
arrived after a call to this function, subsequent calls will return -1.

### DMX transmit

First, create an object using one of the hardware serial ports, different from
any serial ports being used for receive:

```c++
namespace teensydmx = ::qindesign::teensydmx;

teensydmx::Sender dmxTx{Serial2};
```

Before using the instance, start the serial port internals:

```c++
dmxTx.begin();
```

Set one or more channel values using one of the `set` functions:

```c++
// Set channel 6 to 219
dmxTx.set(6, 219);
```

The other `set` function can set multiple channels at once. This is left as an
exercise to the reader.

## Technical notes

### Simultaneous transmit and receive

The same serial port can't be used for simultaneous transmit and receive.
This is because the library uses the serial port hardware for data instead
of direct pin control. The break portion of a DMX frame needs to be
transmitted at a different baud rate than the slots (channels), and since
reception and transmission aren't necessarily synchronized, two different
serial ports must be used.

Use `qindesign::teensydmx::Receiver` to receive and
`qindesign::teensydmx::Sender` to transmit.

### Transmission rate

From a UART perspective, there are two parts to a DMX frame:

1. Break, 83333 (1000000/12) baud, 8N1
2. 513 slots, 250000 baud, 8N2

The total frame time is:

10 bits * 12 us + 513 slots * 11 bits * 4us = 22692us, or a rate of about
44Hz.
