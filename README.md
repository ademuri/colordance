# ColorDance

ColorDance is an art project that uses multiple colored lights pointed at a screen to create colorful shadows.

## Structure

I'm loosely following this guide for project structure: https://rix0r.nl/blog/2015/08/13/cmake-guide/

## Components

### Simulator

ColorDance will eventually have (rather large) hardware. To ease development, the Simulator simulates colored lights pointed at a screen.

TODO: create an actual interface for the simulator.
